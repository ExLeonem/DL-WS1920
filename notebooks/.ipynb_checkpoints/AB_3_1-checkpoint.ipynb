    "We produce training data with two different time scales and a bit of noise. This produces 1000 curves which all follow the same pattern: a fast changing sine wave where the amplitude is modulated by a sine wave with lower frequency. To make it a bit more challenging, we add some noise at each timestep of the waves. All of the 1000 waves have the same pattern, however, the starting point is randomly shifted in time. One such example is shown the plot below. The first 128 data points are used as an input to the model (shown as a line). The model should predict the following 10 data points (shown as points). Note that the future data does not follow a smooth curve, but instead is ragged because of the random noise present in the data."
